# Filter Implementation Test

IIR filter and chirp signal generator implementation in C and  in C++.

The filters are excited with a chirp signal and the filter response is stored as a text file.

Using the filter input and output, the frequency response of the filter is estimated and compared to the theoretical time discrete as well as time continous frequency response.

The evaluation is done in MATLAB and in Python.
